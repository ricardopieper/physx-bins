# physx-bins
PhysX pre-compiled binaries


This adds MacOS M1 precompiled binaries for physx, 
but there are a lot of configs we need to handle to make it actually build, 
and by default it puts files into the `mac.x86_64` folder.

Me and xthexder had no patience to fix that because it's all a proof of concept anyway. 
So don't be fooled: `physx/bin/mac.x86_64` is **actually** Mac M1 ARM64!
